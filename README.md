# Jigsaw Puzzle Solving using Computer Vision

## Overview

This project aims to solve Jigsaw puzzles using computer vision and image processing techniques. It includes algorithms to analyze and assemble puzzle pieces in a manner similar to human thinking.

## Features

**Support for Jigsaw Puzzles**: Handles pieces with various shapes like straight, concave, and convex edges.  
**Support for Square Puzzles**: Requires an original image "Hint" to solve the puzzle.  
**High Accuracy**: Tested on several puzzles with up to 100% accuracy in some cases.  

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- NumPy and SciPy libraries

## Usage

1. Install the requirements via:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
